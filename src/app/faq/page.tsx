          <p>

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">How does the Summary tab work?</h2>
          <p>
            The Summary tab shows a smart overview of your current situation across all groups:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
            <li>How much you owe or are owed</li>
            <li>Who you owe money to, and who owes you</li>
            <li>Recent payments and settlements</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            It&apos;s designed to surface only what matters to you. If everything is settled, it even celebrates that üéâ.

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">How does Toodl minimize payments?</h2>
          <p>
            Toodl calculates everyone&apos;s balances, then automatically figures out the minimal set of payments needed to settle debts. This reduces awkward &quot;Alice pays Bob who pays Carol&aquot; chains. You only see who you personally need to pay or receive from.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">Can I use Toodl offline?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, partially. If you&aposve already opened a group, most of your data is cached locally. You can continue to view and add expenses while offline, and the app will sync once you&apos;re back online.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            However, to share groups or settle across users, internet access is required.

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">Do I need to create an account?</h2>
          <p>
            No! You can use Toodl anonymously. We assign you a temporary ID (e.g., <code>user_b7g9</code>) so you can start splitting expenses immediately.
          </p>

            If you‚Äôd like to save your groups or access from multiple devices, you can sign in via Google or email.

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">Is my data private?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. We store only the data needed to support group expenses. We never sell your information, and all communication is encrypted.

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">Can I settle up directly through the app?</h2>
          <p>
            Currently, Toodl doesn‚Äôt handle direct payments. However, we support integrations like Venmo or PayPal‚Äîjust click ‚ÄúSettle Up‚Äù and choose your preferred method. Once you‚Äôve paid, you can mark the transaction as settled.

          <h2 className="font-semibold text-lg">What happens if two people update the same group?</h2>
          <p>
            The latest update wins. We currently recommend one person manages a group actively at a time. Future updates will support real-time collaboration.
